# 🏥 Smart Clinic Management System - Java Development Capstone Project

Welcome to the **Java Development Capstone Project**! In this project, you'll design and build a **Smart Clinic Management System** — a robust, secure, and scalable full-stack application. You'll leverage technologies like **Java Spring Boot**, **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, **Docker**, and more to solve real-world healthcare problems. 💻🩺

---

## 🚀 Project Scenario

Imagine you're the newest full-stack developer at **SmartCare Solutions**, a digital health startup that aims to revolutionize clinic operations. Many clinics still rely on spreadsheets or outdated systems. You're here to change that.

You'll build an intuitive web portal that empowers doctors and patients to manage appointments, records, and communication—seamlessly and securely.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Databases**: MySQL (Relational), MongoDB (NoSQL)
- **Security**: JWT Authentication
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Architecture**: Microservices, MVC
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Workflows
